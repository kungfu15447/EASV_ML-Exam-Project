In order to run the program, you need to insert the EMNIST Balanced dataset into the project under a folder named "Dataset" (The folder should also be created)
The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/emnist
The files that should be inserted into the folder are the train and test file, as well as the mapping.txt file for the "Balancing" set
